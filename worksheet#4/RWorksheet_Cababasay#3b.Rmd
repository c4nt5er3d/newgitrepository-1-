# 1. Creating and Exploring a Data Frame

# a. Create the data frame
household <- data.frame(
  Sex = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Female"),
  Types_of_Houses = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete", "Concrete", "Wood"),
  Fathers_Occupation = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Farmer", "Others", "Farmer"),
  Number_of_Siblings_Attending = c(3, 5, 2, 6, 7)
)
household

# b. Describe the data (structure and summary)
str(household)
summary(household)

# c. Is the mean number of siblings attending 5?
mean(household$Number_of_Siblings_Attending) == 5
mean(household$Number_of_Siblings_Attending)

# d. Extract the 1st two rows and all columns
household[1:2, ]

# e. Extract 3rd and 5th rows with 2nd and 4th columns
household[c(3,5), c(2,4)]

# f. Select only the variable "Types_of_Houses"
types_houses <- household$Types_of_Houses
types_houses

# g. Select all male respondents whose father's occupation was Farmer
subset(household, Sex == "Male" & Fathers_Occupation == "Farmer")

# h. Select all female respondents with >=5 siblings attending school
subset(household, Sex == "Female" & Number_of_Siblings_Attending >= 5)

# 2. Creating an Empty Data Frame

df <- data.frame(
  Ints = integer(),
  Doubles = double(),
  Characters = character(),
  Logicals = logical(),
  Factors = factor(),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
str(df)

# 3. Importing and Converting CSV Data

# a. Save and import the CSV file
write.csv(household, "HouseholdData.csv", row.names = FALSE)
imported_data <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")
imported_data

# b. Convert Sex to factor, then to integer (Male = 1, Female = 2)
imported_data$Sex <- factor(imported_data$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"), labels = c(1, 2))
imported_data$Sex <- as.integer(imported_data$Sex)
imported_data

# c. Convert Type of Houses to factor, then to integer (Wood = 1, Concrete = 2, Semi-Concrete = 3)
imported_data$Types_of_Houses <- factor(imported_data$Types_of_Houses,
                                        levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"),
                                        labels = c(1, 2, 3))
imported_data$Types_of_Houses <- as.integer(imported_data$Types_of_Houses)
imported_data

# d. Convert Fathers_Occupation to factor, then to integer (Farmer = 1, Driver = 2, Others = 3)
imported_data$Fathers_Occupation <- factor(imported_data$Fathers_Occupation,
                                           levels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"),
                                           labels = c(1, 2, 3))
imported_data$Fathers_Occupation <- as.integer(imported_data$Fathers_Occupation)
imported_data

# e. Select all female respondents (Sex = 2) whose father's occupation is Driver (2)
subset(imported_data, Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == 2)

# f. Select respondents with >=5 siblings attending school
subset(imported_data, Number_of_Siblings_Attending >= 5)

# 4. Interpretation
# The dataset represents household information including gender, housing type, father's occupation, and number of siblings attending school.
# The numeric conversions allow for easier statistical analysis and plotting later.
